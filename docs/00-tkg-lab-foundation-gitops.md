# TKG Lab Foundation for GitOps

Execute the `Foudational Lab Setup` from [tkg-lab](https://github.com/Pivotal-Field-Engineering/tkg-lab).

Then exercise the following bonus labs...

1. [Deploy ArgoCD to Shared Services Cluster](https://github.com/Pivotal-Field-Engineering/tkg-lab/blob/master/docs/bonus-labs/argocd-kustomize.md)
2. [Deploy Kubeapps to Shared Services Cluster](https://github.com/Pivotal-Field-Engineering/tkg-lab/blob/master/docs/bonus-labs/kubeapps.md)

>Note: Previously Harbor deployment was a bonus lab, but recent updates to tkg-lab, Harbor is now part of the base install, so it is not specifically referenced here.
