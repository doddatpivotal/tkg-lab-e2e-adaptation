# Setup Environment Specific Params Yaml

Setup a local params file containing all the environment specific values for the e2e demo.  This is distinct from the params file you used for the `tkg-lab`.  Below is a redacted version of the file I used and I placed it in `/local-config/values.yaml` which is referenced in the `.gitignore`.

>Note: for the kubeconfig references below, I used the following approach to get single line json...

```bash
# Set your context to the build server context, then...
kubectl config view --flatten --minify | yq e - --tojson | jq -c .
# Set your context to the app server context, then...
kubectl config view --flatten --minify | yq e - --tojson | jq -c .
```

```yaml
#@data/values
---
petclinic:
  host: petclinic.ironislands.tkg-vsphere-lab.winterfell.live # Ingress host for your app
  image: harbor.stormsend.tkg-vsphere-lab.winterfell.live/petclinic/spring-petclinic # image, includes your harbor domain and project
  configRepo: https://github.com/doddatpivotal/spring-petclinic-config.git # your k8s config repo, you could just use mine
  codeRepo: https://github.com/doddatpivotal/spring-petclinic.git # your source code repo

  # will configure concourse resource appropriately

## Export Location of Params YAML

```bash
# You can change the location to where you stored your file
export PARAMS_YAML=local-config/values.yaml
```

## [Optional] Automate population of the kubeconfig in your params.yaml

```bash
# Set your context to the build server (Shared Services Cluster), then...
export CONFIG=$(kubectl config view --flatten --minify | yq e - --tojson | jq -c .)
yq e -i '.commonSecrets.kubeconfigBuildServer = strenv(CONFIG)' $PARAMS_YAML

# Change your context to the app server (Workload Cluster), then...
export CONFIG=$(kubectl config view --flatten --minify | yq e - --tojson | jq -c .)
yq e -i '.commonSecrets.kubeconfigAppServer = strenv(CONFIG)' $PARAMS_YAML

# Add back the document seperator that yq removes
sed -i -e '2i\
---
' "$PARAMS_YAML"
rm -f "$PARAMS_YAML-e"

# Clear out the neviornment variable
unset CONFIG
```
