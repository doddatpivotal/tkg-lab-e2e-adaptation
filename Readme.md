# End to End Tanzu Demo

## Overview

This repo provides an end to end Tanzu experience showcasing developer and platform operator perspectives.  The end state enables a demo flow that starts with an update to the Spring Pet Clinic spring boot application and ends with the updated application in production.  Along the way, the CI process compiles, tests, and packages the application, then triggers the Tanzu Build Service to containerize the app and push it to Harbor.  Harbor scans the image for vulnerabilities.  The CD process identifies a new image, publishes a deploy event to Tanzu Observability, and then apply's updated configuration for the app in Tanzu Kubernetes Grid.  The demo also highlights the devops experience provisioning the mysql database used by Spring Pet Clinic using Kubeapps and the Tanzu Application Catalog, as well as monitoring the app specific Tanzu Observability dashboard with the deploy events visible on the charts.  Finally we showcase the platform operator experience setting up daily backups for the Spring Pet Clinic workspace in Tanzu Mission Control and then accessing Kubernetes Cluster Dashboards in Tanzu Observability.
